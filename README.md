## Description:
*Dragon raider* is a ruby-based multilevel game where the player must move around platform-based
stages in order to collect enough of the coins located throughout the stage to proceed to
the next level. The player must also avoid fireballs that explode when they make contact
with the player and are fired by dragons that fly across the screen. The difficulty of the
levels increases by increasing the number of dragons that appear in each stage and
increasing the frequency at which each dragon fires.

The player has a hp bar that decreases each time they are hit by a fireball. When the hp bar
runs out the player loses one of their â€˜lives,â€™ which are displayed at the top of the screen,
and the level resets. The player starts which three lives at the beginning of each level and
therefore has three attempts at completing each level. When all the players lives run out
the player is sent back to the beginning of the first level. The game is complete after the
player passes all of the levels.

The player can also collect mushrooms which are placed across the stage at each level. The
mushrooms are of two types, and each affects the playerâ€™s speed for a set period of time.
The red mushrooms increase the playerâ€™s speed, and the blue mushroom decreases the
playerâ€™s speed. While the player is affected by one of the mushrooms an icon displaying its
effect is displayed onscreen along with a countdown until the effect wears off. Collecting
another mushroom replaces the effect of any mushroom the player has already collected
regardless of the timer.

Enjoy! ðŸ”¥ðŸª™
